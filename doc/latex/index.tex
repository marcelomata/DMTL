 \footnotesize DMTL\normalsize  (Data Mining Template Library) is a frequent patter mining library to mine frequent patterns from massive datasets. It is developed in C++ language by adopting the generic programming idea. Current version of implementation provides complete mining algorithms and testing programs for itemset, sequence, tree and graph pattern mining. But, the framework provides the scope to mine new patterns also. The library is generic with respect to the following aspects:\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern to be mined.\item Input data source and format.\item Data structure to be used in the mining algorithm.\item Storage Management.\item Mining algorithm/approach.\end{itemize}
\section{Platforms supported}\label{index_platforms}
DMTL compiles with gcc 4.0 (and lower) on Mac\-OS X Tiger, and Linux (2.6.10). We expect it to run on other platforms too but we have not performed a through test.

If you have any questions concerning use and development of the {\tt DMTL} library, please mail to {\tt Mohammed Zaki}.
